             <h2 className="text-info">Sultan Mahmud Ekram</h2>
             <p className="fs-3">My name is Ekram, 22, still a student, looking for a part time job I can do while still at school, ideally working remotely. Iâ€™m skilled with javascript and React, and I am trying to learn other programming languages, step by step. Have two brothers, both of them study at a college, so it is quite funny that I, as a boy, decided for software engineering. I try to get the most out of my time at the college, and have some edge once I graduate, which is the primary reason why I seek a part time job with you.</p>
